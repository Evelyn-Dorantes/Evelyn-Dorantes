- Hi, I’m @Evelyn-Dorantes! I'm new to programming, and I was recently introduced to this website to help me further my abilities.
- I’m interested in the social sciences with a focus on political science and economics.
- I’m currently learning R, but I want to learn HTML, CSS, Python, and MatLab – I know, super ambitious to learn so much.
- I'm currently uploading finished projects from university to receive feedback, document progress, and demonstrate my current abilities.

- Thank you for taking the time to read this!! :)
